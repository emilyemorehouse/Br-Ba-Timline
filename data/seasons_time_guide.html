<p><strong>“Pilot,” Season 1, Episode 1 (3 weeks)</strong><br>
The story gets started at precisely 5:02 a.m. of everyman Walt’s 50th birthday and ends three weeks later, where we catch up with the pantsless, post-first-kill Walt we ran into in the episode’s cold open.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>“Cat’s in the Bag … ” Season 1, Episode 2 (3 weeks, 2 days)</strong><br>
After a glimpse of Walt and Jesse’s cleanup of that first kill, we go through the next two days of Walt’s life, during which we see him distractedly teaching the same class in two different shirts and dealing with Krazy 8.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>” … And the Bag’s in the River,” Season 1, Episode 3 (3 weeks, 3 days)</strong><br>
As the elliptical titles suggest, things pick up in this episode right where they were left off in the previous one — Krazy 8′s last day on Earth; the next day, a substitute fills in for Walt while he contemplates what he’ll tell Skyler about that night.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>“Cancer Man,” Season 1, Episode 4 (4 weeks)</strong><br>
An entire weekend passes, as do at least two school days and one visit to the oncologist.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>“Gray Matter,” Season 1, Episode 5 (4 weeks, 6 days)</strong><br>
Another weekend passes, during which Walt and Skyler go to Ramen-loving college chum Elliot’s birthday party; Walt says the party occurred “the other day” toward the episode’s end, just before meeting Jesse.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>“Crazy Handful of Nothin’,” Season 1, Episode 6 (6 weeks, 3 days)</strong><br>
Things are getting in full swing: medical tests, three-day time lapses, cooking, law-enforcing in-laws, Tuco, hair loss, and, finally,&nbsp;<a href="http://nymag.com/daily/entertainment/2011/07/breaking-bad-walt-episodes.html#photo=6x00010" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://nymag.com']);">Walt’s head-shaving transition into Heisenberg</a>.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>“A No-Rough-Stuff-Type Deal,” Season 1, Episode 7 (7 weeks, 3 days)</strong><br>
The season ends with a slew of events (baby shower, oncology visit, moonlit chemical thefts, junkyard meetings with Tuco) that should logically take about a week’s worth of time.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>“Seven Thirty-Seven,” Season 2, Episode 1 (8 weeks, 3 days)</strong><br>
Hank watches the security footage of Walt and Jesse’s meth-ingredient heist and helps us (if not his brother-in-law) out by mentioning that it occurred about ten days ago; Tuco kidnaps Walt and Jesse the next day.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>“Grilled,” Season 2, Episode 2 (8 weeks, 4 days)</strong><br>
The same sun that, uh, grilled Tuco at the episode’s start is still up by the time he dies.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>“Bit by a Dead Bee,” Season 2, Episode 3 (9 weeks)</strong><br>
Hank interrogates Jesse and reveals that Tuco’s death was Sunday and that it’s now Tuesday — one day before the dementia-faking Walt returns home to Skyler, who asks about his second cell phone.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>“Down,” Season 2, Episode 4 (9 weeks, 6 days)</strong><br>
Thank goodness for exposition: Jesse’s parents kick him out of his house while, elsewhere on the same day, Walt refers to the second-cell-phone talk as having occurred “the other night”; then, toward the end, Jesse whines to his mom about having been kicked out “the other day.”</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>“Breakage,” Season 2, Episode 5 (11 weeks, 4 days)</strong><br>
Time speeds up like a methhead as Walt finishes his first stage of chemo with his oncologist and a time-lapse montage zooms through four days of drug dealing, all capped by Walt giving Jesse a gun to use when taking care of business.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>“Peekaboo,” Season 2, Episode 6 (11 weeks, 5 days)</strong><br>
Jesse begins executing his interpretation of taking care of business by going after the methheads that stole from skinny Pete, giving the impression we’re hot on the heels of the last episode.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p><strong>“Better Call Saul,” Season 2, Episode 8 (12 weeks, 2 days)</strong><br>
We jump right back in to catch some of Jesse and Jane’s charming pillow talk. But time waits for no man — least of all for Saul, whose mettle is established to us over a number of days.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>“4 Days Out,” Season 2, Episode 9 (13 weeks, 2 days)</strong><br>
Walt and Jesse cook through a long weekend before realizing they’re trapped in<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">a bottle episode</span>&nbsp;the desert.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>“Over,” Season 2, Episode 10 (14 weeks, 1 day)</strong><br>
Walt, fresh from his escape from the desert, takes a day off from work; then, soon enough, we’re at a weekend get-together; and, finally, Skyler’s at work, flirting with the boss.</p>

<div>
<p><strong>“Mandala,” Season 2, Episode 11 (15 weeks, 3 days)</strong><br>

</div>
<div>
<p><strong>“Phoenix,” Season 2, Episode 12 (19 weeks, 6 days)</strong><br>
We pick up where we left off, in week fifteen, with Walt rushing to meet his new baby. The school week resumes shortly thereafter, and the last thing we see is Walt letting Jane die. Based on the information in the next two episodes — that the plane crashes only a month after Jane’s death, but the baby is also 7 weeks old by then — we have to assume almost four weeks pass before Jane dies, but this doesn’t seem true in the episode. It’s likely there is some continuity problem here.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>“ABQ,” Season 2, Episode 13 (22 weeks, 6 days)</strong><br>
Skyler helpfully tells the oncologist that the baby’s 7 weeks old now; finally, Walt’s household is damaged by both marital separation and debris from a plane crash.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>“No Mas,” Season 3, Episode 1 (23 weeks, 1 days)</strong><br>
Newscasts surrounding the plane crash establish that Jane died about a month ago. Then we jump ahead when Skyler mentions “last week’s” plane crash.</p>

<p><strong>“I See You,” Season 3, Episode 8 (27 weeks, 1 day)</strong><br>
A still-healing Jesse visits Walt’s swanky new lab, bringing up his feeling toward that “sunset” from “a couple of days ago”; the episode ends the next night, with Hank in the hospital.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p><strong>“Half Measures,” Season 3, Episode 12 (30 weeks, 5 days)</strong><br>
Wendy gives a string of blow jobs over a time-lapsed montage, the first of many; later, on the episode’s last night, Walt starts murdering people for Jesse.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>“Thirty-Eight Snub,” Season 4, Episode 2 (33 weeks 4 days)</strong><br>

Starts next day. &nbsp;One more day passes and in the evening we hear Gus tell Jesse he “sees things in people”.</p>
<p><strong>“Problem Dog,” Season 4, Episode 7 (38 weeks)</strong><br>
Starts a couple of days later. &nbsp;Couple days pass and Walt gives the ricin to Jesse. &nbsp;Later in the episode we are led to believe one week has passed since Walt gave Jesse the ricin due to Walt arguing with Jesse over how long it has been.</p>
<p><strong>“Hermanos,” Season 4, Episode 8 (42 weeks)</strong><br>
Starts a couple of days later. &nbsp;Gus is questioned. &nbsp;Roughly 2-3 weeks pass during this episode due to the amount of money Skyler hides and because when Jesse and Saul are talking it seems like he has been doing weekly deliveries to Andrea a couple of times. &nbsp;Then Hank has Walt put the tail on Gus’ car.</p>
<p><strong>“Bug,” Season 4, Episode 9 (43 weeks)</strong><br>
Roughly 3 days since the bugging of Gus’ car since he has gone back and forth to work 3 times, so this means this episode starts 2 days after the previous. &nbsp;Two days later Jesse visits Gus’ house. &nbsp;The next day Jesse and Walt fight.</p>

<p><strong>“Live Free or Die,” Season 5, Episode 1 (46 weeks)</strong><br>
Starts with the same day, but you are led to assume some time has passed since Hank walks around the lab with a cane. &nbsp;Roughly one week passes and Mike, Jesse, and Walt decide to use the magnet on Gus’ laptop.</p>
<p><strong>“Madrigal,” Season 5, Episode 2 (47 weeks)</strong><br>
You assume a couple of days have passed and Mike is interrogated by Hank.</p>
<p><strong>“Hazard Pay,” Season 5, Episode 3 (50 weeks)</strong><br>
2-3 weeks pass from last episode. &nbsp;This is a bit difficult to tell, but I am going off of previous time frames, when Walt’s birthday is, and how long it would take to have Mike change his mind and work with Walt. &nbsp;Mike, Jesse and Walt team up and work with Vamanos Pest Control.</p>
<p><strong>“Fifty-One,” Season 5, Episode 4 (52 weeks) [Title Corrected] </strong><br>
