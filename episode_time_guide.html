    <p>Fans of <em>Breaking Bad</em>, which returns for its fourth season this Sunday, know that nothing '97 not even meth '97 is more valuable to Walter White than time. He doesn't have much of it left, what with the cancer and his wholehearted <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2011/07/10_tensest_moments_in_breaking.html">embrace</a> of a <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2011/07/breaking_bad_creator_vince_gil.html">life-threatening profession</a>. It's fitting, then, that the show rarely leaves time unaccounted for, making us watch and savor almost every excruciating minute of Walt's life. But as a result, <em>Breaking Bad</em> is not running at the same speed as the real world. The show started airing three and a half years ago, back in January of 2008, but its three seasons haven't covered anywhere near three years in Walt's life. By our count, come Sunday, Walt will have been breaking bad for little more than seven months. Check out this episode-by-episode guide of how we arrived at this calculation. </p>

    <p><strong>"Pilot," Season 1, Episode 1 (3 weeks)</strong><br>
The story gets started at precisely 5:02 a.m. of everyman Walt's 50th birthday and ends three weeks later, where we catch up with the pantsless, post-first-kill Walt we ran into in the episode's cold open.</p>

After a glimpse of Walt and Jesse's cleanup of that first kill, we go through the next two days of Walt's life, during which we see him distractedly teaching the same class in two different shirts and dealing with Krazy 8.</p>

</div>
<div class="parbase section entrytext">



    <p><strong>" ... And the Bag's in the River," Season 1, Episode 3 (3 weeks, 3 days)</strong><br>
As the elliptical titles suggest, things pick up in this episode right where they were left off in the previous one '97 Krazy 8's last day on Earth; the next day, a substitute fills in for Walt while he contemplates what he'll tell Skyler about that night.</p>

We pick up where we left off, in week fifteen, with Walt rushing to meet his new baby. The school week resumes shortly thereafter, and the last thing we see is Walt letting Jane die. Based on the information in the next two episodes '97 that the plane crashes only a month after Jane's death, but the baby is also 7 weeks old by then '97 we have to assume almost four weeks pass before Jane dies, but this doesn't seem true in the episode. It's likely there is some continuity problem here. </p>
